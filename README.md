# OpenAI Demo Project

## Description

This is a demo project I created to learn and test the openai npm package Get
you own API key at platform.openai.com. Then edit the .txt.RENAME_ME file to
.env, update it with your API key and Org ID. Currently everything runs from the
root index.js file. The routes and models are set but not currently 100% used.
Have fun!

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Rename the .txt.RENAME_ME file to .env and update it with your API key and
   Org ID
4. Run `node index.js` to start the server
5. Open your browser to localhost:PORT ( it may be 127.0.0.1 instead of
   localhost)
